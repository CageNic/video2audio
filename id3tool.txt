 The programs follow the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options starting with two
       dashes (`-').  A complete list of options are included below.  For a complete description,
       use the help option.

       -t, --set-title

       -a, --set-album

       -r, --set-artist

       -y, --set-year

       -n, --set-note

       -g, --set-genre

       -G, --set-genre-word

       -c, --set-track=INT

       -h, --help

       -v, --version

       -l, --genre-list

id3tool is yet another command line utility that can help us edit the ID3 tags of an MP3 file. It’s a very lightweight and straightforward tool to use.

Installation

id3tool may not be installed by default. On Ubuntu, we can install it simply:

$ sudo apt install id3tool

The package name and the package manager may be different for other distributions. After installing, let’s run the command with the -h flag to see what it can do:

$ id3tool --help
id3tool version 1.2a
...(more output)

The help message prints all the fields that can be edited along with other useful information.

Viewing and Editing ID3 Tags

To view the tags present in an MP3 file, we simply run the id3tool command with the path to the file as a positional argument:

$ id3tool my_music_file.mp3
Filename: my_music_file.mp3
Song Title:	My Favorite Song              
Artist:		My Favorite Artist            
Album:		My Favorite Album             
Track:		1
Year:		2002

To change the tags, we can run the command with the required flags and the corresponding values:

$ id3tool -t "In The End" -a "Hybrid Theory" -r "Linkin Park" -y 2000 -c 8 my_music_file.mp3

$ id3tool my_music_file.mp3
Filename: my_music_file.mp3
Song Title:	In The End                    
Artist:		Linkin Park                   
Album:		Hybrid Theory                 
Track:		8
Year:		2000

In the first command, we used the flags -t, -a, -r, -y, and -c to edit the track title, album name, artist’s name, year, and track number fields respectively. Later, we ran the view command to verify that the change has occurred.
